# godot-llightmap
Lightmap module for Godot Engine 3.x
Version 0.1

## Compiling
Due to using SSE2, this will probably only compile on x86_64, on linux and (hopefully) windows. I'll fix up the reference methods so it will compile on other platforms soon. However, most people will only need it to create lightmaps on desktop, the lightmaps produced can be used with a standard build of the engine.
